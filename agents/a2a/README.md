# Travel Booking Agents

Two AI agents built with AWS Bedrock AgentCore and the Strands framework for flight search and booking.

## Agents

**Travel Assistant Agent** (`travel_assistant_agent`)
- Searches for available flights between cities
- Provides flight recommendations based on price and preferences
- Returns detailed flight information (times, prices, airlines)
- **Discovers other agents** through the MCP Gateway Registry
- [Full specification](https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry/issues/196)

**Flight Booking Agent** (`flight_booking_agent`)
- Checks flight availability and seat counts
- Creates flight reservations
- Manages booking database
- [Full specification](https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry/issues/197)

## Deployment Options

### Local Docker Container

Run agents locally with full FastAPI server including custom API endpoints.

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker and Docker Compose
- AWS credentials configured (via AWS_PROFILE, EC2 IAM role, or ~/.aws/credentials)
- `uv sync --extra dev` to install main dependencies and development ones

**Deploy:**
```bash
# Configure AWS credentials (one of these methods)
export AWS_PROFILE=your_profile_name

# Or use EC2 IAM role (no export needed)

# Then deploy (auto-detects your system architecture)
# From repo root:
agents/a2a/deploy_local.sh

# Or from agents/a2a directory:
./deploy_local.sh
```

**Architecture Support:**
The script automatically detects your system architecture:
- **Intel/AMD Macs and Linux:** Uses `docker-compose.local.yml` (x86_64)
- **Apple Silicon Macs:** Uses `docker-compose.arm.yml` (ARM64)

To override auto-detection:
```bash
# Force ARM64 (Apple Silicon) - from repo root
agents/a2a/deploy_local.sh --arm64

# Force x86_64 (Intel/AMD) - from repo root
agents/a2a/deploy_local.sh --x86_64

# Show help - from repo root
agents/a2a/deploy_local.sh --help

# Or from agents/a2a directory:
./deploy_local.sh --arm64
./deploy_local.sh --x86_64
./deploy_local.sh --help
```

**Endpoints:**
- Travel Assistant: `http://localhost:9001`
- Flight Booking: `http://localhost:9002`
- Custom APIs: `/api/search-flights`, `/api/recommendations`, `/api/check-availability`
- Health check: `/ping`

### AgentCore Runtime (AWS)

Deploy agents to AWS managed infrastructure with automatic scaling.

**Prerequisites:**
- AWS credentials configured (via AWS_PROFILE, EC2 IAM role, or ~/.aws/credentials)
- AgentCore CLI: `pip install bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit`

**Deploy:**
```bash
# Configure AWS credentials (one of these methods)
export AWS_PROFILE=your_profile_name

# Or use EC2 IAM role (no export needed)

# Then deploy
./deploy_live.sh
```

**Note:** The deployment script automatically builds ARM64 images for AgentCore Runtime compatibility. The `docker-compose.arm.yml` file defines the ARM64 build targets used during deployment.

**Access:**
- Agents accessible via A2A protocol only
- ARNs shown in deployment output
- CloudWatch logs for monitoring

## Testing

### Agent Card Endpoint (Local)

Test the agent card endpoint locally to verify agent metadata. The script retrieves and displays agent card information, and saves JSON files locally for reference.

**Run the check:**

```bash
# From repo root
agents/a2a/test/check_agent_cards.sh

# Or from agents/a2a directory
cd agents/a2a
./test/check_agent_cards.sh
```

**Output Files:**

Agent cards are saved to the `agents/a2a/test/` directory:
- `travel_assistant_agent_card.json` - Travel Assistant agent metadata
- `flight_booking_agent_card.json` - Flight Booking agent metadata

These files contain:
- Agent name and description
- Available tools and capabilities
- API endpoints and methods
- Input/output schemas

> **Next Steps:** For remote testing of deployed agents, consider using the [A2A Inspector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agentcore-testing.html) to interact with and debug your AgentCore Runtime deployments.

### Agent and API Tests

Run comprehensive tests against local or live deployments to verify agent functionality:

**Test Coverage:**
- **Health Checks:** Verify agents are responsive via `/ping` endpoint
- **Agent Communication (A2A Protocol):** Send natural language requests to agents and verify responses
  - Travel Assistant: Flight search queries
  - Flight Booking: Availability checks and reservations
- **Direct API Endpoints:** Test custom FastAPI endpoints (local only)
  - `/api/search-flights` - Flight search with parameters
  - `/api/recommendations` - Price-based recommendations
  - `/api/check-availability` - Seat availability checks
- **Response Validation:** Verify response structure and content accuracy

**Run Tests:**

```bash
# Test local Docker containers (from repo root)
uv run python agents/a2a/test/simple_agents_test.py --endpoint local

# Test local Docker containers (from agents/a2a directory)
cd agents/a2a
uv run python test/simple_agents_test.py --endpoint local

# Test AgentCore Runtime (from repo root)
uv run python agents/a2a/test/simple_agents_test.py --endpoint live
```

**Debug Mode:**

For detailed request/response tracing, use the `--debug` flag:

```bash
# View full JSON-RPC payloads, response bodies, and timing (from repo root)
uv run python agents/a2a/test/simple_agents_test.py --endpoint local --debug

# Or from agents/a2a directory:
uv run python test/simple_agents_test.py --endpoint local --debug
```

This displays:
- Complete JSON-RPC request payloads
- Full agent response bodies with artifacts
- Response timing and HTTP status codes
- Streaming data for agent reasoning

## Deployment Scripts

### deploy_local.sh
Deploys and starts the agents locally in Docker containers.

**Features:**
- Auto-detects your system architecture (x86_64 or ARM64)
- Validates AWS credentials using the credential chain
- Removes and recreates containers and volumes for a clean deployment
- Builds Docker images locally before starting

**Usage (from repo root):**
```bash
agents/a2a/deploy_local.sh                 # Auto-detect architecture
agents/a2a/deploy_local.sh --arm64         # Force ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
agents/a2a/deploy_local.sh --x86_64        # Force x86_64 (Intel/AMD)
agents/a2a/deploy_local.sh --help          # Show usage options
```

**Usage (from agents/a2a directory):**
```bash
./deploy_local.sh                 # Auto-detect architecture
./deploy_local.sh --arm64         # Force ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
./deploy_local.sh --x86_64        # Force x86_64 (Intel/AMD)
./deploy_local.sh --help          # Show usage options
```

### shutdown_local.sh
Stops and removes all containers, networks, and volumes.

**Usage (from repo root):**
```bash
agents/a2a/shutdown_local.sh
```

**Usage (from agents/a2a directory):**
```bash
./shutdown_local.sh
```

This is useful when you want to completely clean up before redeploying or when done testing locally.

## Key Differences

| Feature | Local Docker | AgentCore Runtime |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| A2A Protocol | ✅ | ✅ |
| Custom API Endpoints | ✅ | ❌ |
| Health Check `/ping` | ✅ | ❌ |
| Deployment | Docker Compose | AgentCore CLI |

**Note:** Custom FastAPI endpoints (like `/api/search-flights`) are only available in local Docker deployments. **AgentCore Runtime only wraps the container and exposes the standard A2A conversational interface.**
